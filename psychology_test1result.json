            "a":"You are very hard to throw off-balance. You are a calm person who tries to see only the good side of things. Due to your inner strength and optimism, negative situations do not put pressure on you. People like you are often asked for help or advice. Support your loved ones and share your positive energy with them.",
            "b":"You seem to always be on the brink of a breakdown and are about to explode. A low level of susceptibility to stress leads to health problems such as insomnia or frequent nightmares. Don't keep all of your emotions suppressed all the time and don't let any little thing annoy you. This can cause migraines, nausea, and other complications.",
            "c":"You tend to create a problem out of anything. Your habit of getting all worked up leads to frequent stress. You should pull yourself together and stop wasting energy on groundless worries. Faced with a difficult situation, try to look at it from another angle. To make fighting the stress easier, try doing breathing exercises - they can really help. Take a deep breath through your nose and exhale slowly through your mouth."
